The objective of this project is to create a current amplifier that can convert the input current into voltage and amplify the voltage flowing through the circuit. 
The amplifier should have a selectable gain feature, which means that the user can choose the amount of amplification required by selecting the resistor. 
The gain selection could be done through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) display.
