📡 Charge Amplifier with Selectable Gain using Arduino
This project implements a charge amplifier circuit interfaced with an Arduino to allow dynamic selection of gain using software. It is particularly useful for interfacing with piezoelectric sensors and other charge-based signal sources in precision measurement or sensing systems.

🔧 Features
✅ Charge amplifier design with capacitor feedback
✅ Gain selection via digital control using Arduino
✅ Selectable gain stages: High, Medium, Low
✅ Analog signal readout and plotting via Serial Monitor / Python GUI
✅ Ideal for piezoelectric sensors, force transducers, and vibration monitoring
