# âš¡ Voltage Gain Controller using Arduino

Measure. Calculate. Control.  
A minimal yet powerful Arduino-based system that lets you measure voltage, calculate gain, and switch outputsâ€”all through a serial interface.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project is a simple but effective tool to:

âœ… Read analog voltage from a sensor or input source  
âœ… Calculate gain based on user-defined input voltage  
âœ… Control output pins to select gain modes (or any user-defined function)  
âœ… Interact via **Serial commands** (compatible with Serial Monitor or Nextion displays)

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### ðŸ“¥ Input
- Analog voltage is read from **A7**
- Input voltage is entered via Serial

### ðŸ“¤ Output
- Output voltage (`Vout`) is printed on command
- Gain = Vout / Vin is calculated
- Based on selection, **one of D2â€“D5** is set HIGH (others LOW)

---

## ðŸ”§ Supported Serial Commands

| ðŸ”¤ Command | ðŸ§¾ Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| `Vout`    | Displays the real-time analog voltage at pin A7 |
| `input`   | Takes user input voltage after delay, calculates and prints gain |
| `gain`    | Waits for value `1` to `4` and activates corresponding digital output |

### ðŸ“Ÿ Example Usage

```plaintext
> Vout
< t1.txt="3.12 V"

> input
(wait 5 sec...)
> 2.00
< t6.txt="1.56"

> gain
(wait 3 sec...)
> 2
(Output pin D3 is set HIGH, others LOW)
```
